### Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. This course is self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

**Topics covered**:
`simple programs`
`simple data structures`

Courses | Duration | Effort | Prerequisites | Discussion

[Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/lessons) | 10 weeks | 10 hours/week | none | [chat](https://discord.gg/syA242Z)

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science. Students who have been introduced to programming, either from the courses above or through study elsewhere, should take this course for a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

**Topics covered**:
`computation`
`imperative programming`
`basic data structures and algorithms`
`and more`

## How to show my progress

1. Create an account in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/OZrnXg4l/ossu-computer-science).

- `Main Curriculum`: cards with that label represent courses that are listed in our curriculum.
- `Extra Resources`: cards with that label represent courses that were added by the student.
- `Doing`: cards with that label represent courses the student is currently doing.
- `Done`: cards with that label represent courses finished by the student.
Those cards should also have the link for at least one project/article built with the knowledge acquired in such a course.
- `Section`: cards with that label represent the section that we have in our curriculum.
Those cards with the `Section` label are only to help the organization of the Done column.
You should put the *Course's cards* below its respective *Section's card*.
